    <h3>Chess Puzzle Solving - inspired by <a href="https://www.puzzle-chess.com/">Puzzle Chess</a></h3>
</div>
A Pygame-based chess puzzle game inspired by traditional chess mechanics but designed with unique, challenging puzzle modes. CPS includes a built-in map creator and real-time visualization of pathfinding algorithms like A*, BFS, and DFS solving the board.

## 🌟 Features

* **Three Unique Game Modes:**
    * **Ranger Mode:** Only white pieces are used. Standard chess movement rules apply, and every move must be a capture.
    * **Melee Mode:** Alternating turns between white and black pieces, requiring continuous captures until one piece remains.
    * **Solo Mode:** A restrictive mode where only white pieces are used, the King cannot be captured, and every piece can only move a maximum of two times.
* **Built-in Map Creator:** Design, test, and save your own custom puzzles. The creator includes an algorithmic solvability check before saving.
* **Algorithm Visualizer:** Watch search algorithms (A*, BFS, DFS) solve the puzzles in real-time right on the board.
* **Customizable Settings:** Adjust target FPS, play speed, and algorithm search animation duration.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, 3.12+ is recommended.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  Launch the game to access the main menu.
2.  Select a puzzle mode: **Ranger**, **Melee**, or **Solo**.
3.  Click and drag a piece to valid capture squares highlighted on the board.
4.  If you get stuck, use the **A***, **BFS**, or **DFS** buttons on the right panel to let the AI find the solution for you. Click the "Play" button next to the algorithm to watch the winning sequence.
5.  Want to build your own? Click **Map Creator** from the main menu, place your pieces, test the board, and save it to the database.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

The game models the board as a state-space graph to evaluate winning paths. 
* **A\* Search (A\*):** Uses a heuristic based on the number of pieces remaining ($h = pieces\_count - 1$) to efficiently find the shortest sequence of captures.
* **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores all possible capture sequences level by level.
* **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Dives deep into specific capture sequences until it hits a dead end or solves the board.
